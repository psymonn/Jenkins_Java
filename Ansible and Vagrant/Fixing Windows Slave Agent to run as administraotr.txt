Install jenkins windows slave as a service
using web console but getting WMI.WmiException: AccessDenied
quite out of the java applet
remove everyting exept slave-agent.jnlp in your remotefolder
create a cmd shortcut on remotefolder
run cmd as administrator
cd c:/remotefolder
./slave-agent.jnlp
java applet popped up and choose run as windows service

If you are running this way you would need to install the CA on windows keystore
If you run it as headless by excuting java -jar agent.jar....then you would need to install the CA on Java JDK
