About the Infrastructure Overview in ITSI
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ITSI/4.11.2/Entity/InfraOverview
Kubernetes Node*  Collect Kubernetes metrics and logs with Splunk App for Infrastructure
Kubernetes Pod*   (*) ITSI doesn't currently have a Kubernetes integration. Discover Kubernetes entities in Splunk App for Infrastructure (SAI) and view them in ITSI. 
                  For more information, see Integrate the Splunk App for Infrastructure with ITSI.


About the Splunk App for Infrastructure
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/InfraApp/2.2.4/Admin/AddDataKubernetes
   Install the Splunk App for Infrastructure in a single-instance deployment
   https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/InfraApp/2.2.4/Install/Install
		Configure the HTTP Event Collector to receive metrics data for SAI
		https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/InfraApp/2.2.4/Admin/HEC
			em_metrics is the default metrics index to send data you receive from HEC. If you want to use another metrics index, specify it when you create the HEC token instead. 
			If you use another index, you have to update the sai_metrics_indexes macro, too. For more information about using another index, see Use custom metric indexes in Splunk App for Infrastructure.
			
				indexer: em_metrics
				
Note: we are using Splunk connect so this steps are superceded

				
IT Service Intellgence:

Splunk Observability Cloud content packs analysis:

Service Analyzer:
doesn't support on-prem Kubernetes Pod Service only support Kubernetes Pod which pulled from Cloud Observability SaaS that uses the Observability Cloud content packs. 
Deep Dives feature depends the Service, we cannot create Kubernetes Pod

Deep Dives:
doesn't support on-prem

Glass Tables:
doesn't support on-prem

Insfrastructure Overiew
support on-prem, however this is a free feature (IT Essential free version already include this feature, this feature is added from Splunk App Infrasture - SAI)
This will provide metric service to kubernete pods and nodes however it is very limited features

Summary:
We can't use any ITSI functionlity for Kubernetes purpose
