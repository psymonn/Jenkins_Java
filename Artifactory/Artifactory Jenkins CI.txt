Jenkins build steps:
build -> libs-snapshot-local (first build download all dependencies from artifact repo)
build again -> much faster
artifactory release staging (shown up)  after run the build the version are changed and committed to the master (git)
      artifactory now have the release version. e.g multi1-3.5.jar
Artifactory Release Promotion (show up after release staging)
      artifactory release history -> have release and stage  info.
      artifactory -> publish modules -> select artifact -> multi-3.5.jar -> choose path should takes u directory to the libs-release-repo
